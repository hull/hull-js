# Hull.js [ ![Codeship Status for hull/hull-js](https://circleci.com/gh/hull/hull-js/tree/develop.png?circle-token=26a17dad6ac378f6028a460a5857d5ca15a8aa13) ](https://circleci.com/gh/hull/hull-js)

# Building the library

Checkout

    git@github.com:hull/hull-js.git

First, install grunt and bower

    sudo npm install -g grunt-cli

Then switch to hull-js dir

    cd hull-js
    npm install
    grunt

The last command will start a static HTTP server (port `3001`) that serves the files located in
the root folder.

## Using the boilerplate app

A boilerplate app is located in the `app` folder. Here's how to use it:

```
cp app/app.example.js app/app.js
grunt
open http://localhost:3001/app
```

__Note__: You must configure `app/app.js` with the settings of your app,
as found in your account at [https://accounts.hullapp.io](https://accounts.hullapp.io).

# Main `grunt` tasks

* `dist`: Builds and executes the tests
* `server` (default task): `dist` + starts a static HTTP server for local use
* `deploy`: `dist` + [Additional flavors](http://hull.io/docs/hull_js/#flavors) + S3 upload (see below)

# Deploying to S3 :

We use S3 internally. A grunt task to deploy in S3 is provided.
If you want to deploy to S3 too, follow these instructions:

Create the file `.grunt/grunt-aws.json`, with the following content :

    {
      "key":"YOUR_AWS_KEY",
      "secret":"YOUR_AWS_SECRET",
      "bucket":"YOUR_AWS_BUCKET" // Without the "s3.amazonaws.com" part
    }


# Developing locally (force @hull components to be fetched locally)

    <script src="http://localhost/dist/%%CURRENT_VERSION%%/hull.js"></script>
    <script>
      Hull.init({
        appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
        orgUrl: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
        jsUrl: 'http://localhost/dist'
      });
    </script>
